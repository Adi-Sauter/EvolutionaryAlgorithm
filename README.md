# EvolutionaryAlgorithm

This repository contains the files from an assignment (Assignment2_22_23.pdf) in the course "Computational Intelligence" which I took during my Erasmus semester. The goal of the assignment was to implement an algorithm which tackles the timetable-scheduling problem. The file Timetable_Scheduling.py contains the code and the .json files contain examples of different difficulties. The final report can be found in EA_Sauter_Haege_Cardona.pdf.
